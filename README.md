## General üß¢
API :
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols allowing different software to communicate with each other. It defines the available functionalities, how to use them, and how to integrate them into other applications.

REST API :
A REST API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for distributed systems, based on HTTP, which uses standard methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to access and manipulate resources via URIs.

CSV format :
The CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format is a file format where data is stored in a table-like structure, with values separated by commas. It's commonly used for exchanging tabular data between different applications.

JSON format :
The JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format is a lightweight data exchange format, readable by humans and easy to understand for machines. It's widely used for transmitting structured data on the Web.

## Requirements üëÆ
- Executable files.
- Libraries imported in the Python files must be organized in alphabetical order.
- Use `pycodestyle`.
- Modules should have documentation
- Use `get` to access to dictionary value by key.
- Code should not be executed when imported (by using `if __name__ == "__main__"`)

## Tasks ‚òëÔ∏è
0. Gather data from an API :
    - Write a Python script that, using this REST API, for a given employee ID, returns information about his/her TODO list progress.
1. Export to CSV :
    - Using what I did in the task #0, extend my Python script to export data in the CSV format.
2. Export to JSON :
    - Using what I did in the task #0, extend my Python script to export data in the JSON format.
3. Dictionary of list of dictionaries:
    - Using what I did in the task #0, extend my Python script to export data in the JSON format.
